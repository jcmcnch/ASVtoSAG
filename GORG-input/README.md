1. Took samples that had SSU hit according to Maria et al
2. Separated into 3 categories
3. Each separately predicted using barrnap to get rRNA (using domain-appropriate db)
4. 16S pulled out of resulting fasta files using pattern matching
5. 16S used to create blastdb for ASVs

Raw data can be pulled down from https://osf.io/pcwj9/files/

Additionally checked remaining SAGs that were not noted as having SSU rRNA in Maria's paper. Found 27 additional 16S sequences, which were added to the blastdb as well.
